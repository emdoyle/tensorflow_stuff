    "This was sort of a pain to install, but the good news is it's all set up now and I have openCV 3.3.0 installed as well.  Basically [this](http://multineat.com/docs.html) is the extent of the documentation since I don't believe this library has been widely used.  It's also not fully compatible with the current `boost` version (1.65) because one of the header files was removed (`numeric.hpp`) so I used `cython` to build it instead (although the new files related to Traits require me to have `boost` installed anyway."

    "NEAT stands for [\"NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) and is a genetic algorithm for evolving neural networks.  It is based on the idea that mutation, speciation, and natural selection can begin with very simple structures and eventually evolve complex topologies that maximize a given fitness function."
